# Social Network · Next.js · React

Profiles, feeds, communities and moderation. Independent React application with explicit Next.js server/client boundaries.

This is a presentation skeleton. Product workflows, identity integration and reviewed API adapters must be implemented and verified before production use. Module plans describe intended behavior; they are not installed or published packages.

Based on [project-boilerplate-next-react](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-boilerplate-next-react) at `c858d8a2611ae7acb0aedcec374ee408a02290b7`.

## Start locally

Clone this repository, enter its directory and use the declared toolchain and committed lockfiles:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Use Node from `.node-version`. Keep API credentials and session integration server-only. Default protected API reads to no-store until a tenant-aware cache policy is reviewed. Application routes, deployment and authentication composition belong here; reusable UI libraries have independent npm manifests. The initial shell makes no API calls.

## Verify and extend

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [integration responsibilities](docs/INTEGRATION.md), the [presentation runbook](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/guides/presentation/NEXTJS.md) and the [product scope](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/projects/social-network/README.md). Enable one vertical journey at a time against reviewed contracts. Verify allowed, denied, wrong-tenant, expired-session, validation and concurrency outcomes when implementing protected behavior. A pending operation is not a completed business transition.
